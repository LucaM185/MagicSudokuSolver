What makes this project interesting is that it takes an image as the only input and outputs the right solution for the sudoku

1) The screenshots gets quickly analysed to detect straight lines and their intersections
2) It automatically finds the sudoku form the vertices of the square around it
3) It uses a machine learning model trained on digits to read the numbers
4) And finishes by brute forcing the solution with some tricks to make it faster
